# My Portfolio Website
Hello and welcome to my Professional Portfolio Website repository! This website serves as the culmination of all that I have learned since I began programming just a few years ago - as well as throughout my time in college as I pursued a degree in Computer Engineering - and as such I have spent many months working on it and perfecting it for the use of employers and any others who are interested in my work. So, before we get into it, I would very much like to take the time to express how much I appreciate you for taking the time to stop by and seeing all that this website and repository has to offer. 

Now let's get to it!
